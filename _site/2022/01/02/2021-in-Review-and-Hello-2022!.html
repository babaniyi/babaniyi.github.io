<p>Happy new year!! 😅
Better late than never right?</p>

<p>2021 was a great year for me. One of the reasons being that I managed to update my personal wesbite(This one) and get back into writing. Even though I am not doing it as much yet, I am still happy that I managed to change the look and feel of the platform and I am happy with the outcome. I used to do year in review posts when I first started writing and I used to enjoy it because it made it easy for me to look back and reflect on what I managed to do in the previous year and that would fuel the fire to do more the coming year.</p>

<p>I know it’s abit too late for reviews but, I really do need some motivation to get on here and write. So, I thought why not share my wins from last year and that will probably drive my motivation for the things I want to do this year. Well, I hope this works!</p>

<h1 id="2021-in-review">2021 in Review</h1>

<p>Like I’ve mentioned 2021 was a pretty good and productive year for me, it had its share of ups and downs but generally, It was a good year. I was just from completing my Masters’ in Ghana and I was pumped. Here’s a little recap of what I did last year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>💻 Built a Machine Translation platform for solely African Languages.</li>
  <li>💻 Updated Personal Website.</li>
  <li>😀Started a new job at Visa! One of my biggest goals in 2021 was to get a new job at an international corporation.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="2022-at-a-glance">2022 at a Glance</h1>

<ul>
  <li>💻 Machine Learning Engineer Certificate</li>
  <li>✍️ Write more!</li>
  <li>👩‍🏫 Mentor more students!</li>
  <li>📚 Read More!</li>

</ul>
