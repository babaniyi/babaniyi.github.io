Hi There ðŸ‘‹, I'm Babaniyi Olaniyi. A Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer experienced in building models and performing data analysis to transform them into insights for business decision making. Highly skilled in designing scalable, reliable & robust data pipelines to enable data-driven business decisions. 

Currently, I am a Data Scientist at [Bensh AI](https://benshi.ai), I focus on applying machine learning to serve users at scale, from demand forecasting and experimentation models to building reinforcement learning systems for mobile health recommendations.

In the past, while working as a Freelance Data Scientist, I built a marketing attribution model that helped an organization focus on marketing channels that were working increasing customer growth by 2%. Additionally, I built a customer segmentation model to determine how to communicate with different customer types at The Alchemist Atelier.

I completed my Masters' in Quantitative Economics from the [Autonomous University of Barcelona](https://uab.cat) and [University of Paris Pantheon-Sorbonne ](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/en) under the Erasmus program.

I received the `Erasmus Mundus` scholarship grant of â‚¬42k in 2017 and was accepted to the Google Africa Developer Scholarship in 2021. Prior to that, I was awarded the Outstanding Academic Accomplishment award by `Dr. Bukola Saraki Foundation` in 2016, `NIIT` scholarship in 2015 and `Kingshouse Learning Center` to study Computer Engineering in 2012.

My current interests are in applying machine to solve business problems. I particularly enjoy deploying recommendation systems, designing experiments and forecasting models to serve customers at scale.
