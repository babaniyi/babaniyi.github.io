Currently, I am a Data Scientist at [Bensh AI](https://benshi.ai) where I focus on applying machine learning to serve users at scale, from demand forecasting and experimentation models to building reinforcement learning systems for mobile health recommendations.

In the past, while working as a Freelance Data Scientist, I built a marketing attribution model that helped an organization focus on marketing channels that were working increasing customer growth by 2%. Additionally, I built a customer segmentation model to determine how to communicate with different customer types at The Alchemist Atelier.

I completed my Masters' in Quantitative Economics from the [Autonomous University of Barcelona](https://uab.cat) and [University of Paris Pantheon-Sorbonne ](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/en) under the Erasmus program.

I received the `Erasmus Mundus` scholarship grant in 2017 and was accepted to the `Google Africa Developers` Program in 2021. Before that, I was awarded the Outstanding Academic Accomplishment award by `Dr. Bukola Saraki Foundation` in 2016, `NIIT` scholarship in 2015 and `Kingshouse Learning Center` to study Computer Engineering in 2012.

My current interests are in applying machine learning to solve business problems. I particularly enjoy deploying recommendation systems, designing experiments and forecasting models to predict future outcomes.
