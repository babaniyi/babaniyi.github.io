title:  👋 Hi, I'm Babaniyi!
---

I'm Babaniyi Olaniyi, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer. I am very interested in using my expertise of data science and machine learning to understand some of the underlying patterns in retail, banking, consulting, and industry. I am also very thrilled about the moment we live in and the rate at which data is being generated and utilized as an asset.


While you're still here feel free to..
- Check out my previous [blog posts](https://babaniyi.substack.com).
- Look at some of the things I have worked on in [Projects](https://babaniyi.github.io/portfolio/) or on [![github](/images/github_icon.png)](https://github.com/babaniyi)
