I'm Catherine Gitau and this is my personal website where I write about all things data science, machine learning, deep learning and NLP. 

I currently work as a Data Scientist at Visa Inc. and working towards being a full-stack data scientist. I enjoy doing data science to generate business insights but also enjoy building products around them. Therefore, I'm aspiring to be a good Machine Learning Engineer so that I can easily build such products. I also do research on NLP, specifically applied to African langauges. So, if any one of these is what you're interested in, then you're at the right place!
