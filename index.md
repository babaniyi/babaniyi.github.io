I'm Babaniyi Olaniyi, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer. I am deeply excited about the time we live in and the rate at which data is being generated and transformed as an asset hence i am keen to leverage my knowledge of data science and machine learning to grasp some of the underlying trends in retail, finance, consulting and industry.
